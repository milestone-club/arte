## A Skill exchange platform

<!--
### Motive:
Many students have a hard time learning new skills all by themselves through online resources or courses, and most of the time they would need help from someone who has expertise in that particular skill. This platform acts like a give-and-take connection, connecting people who can teach each other. This can encourage students to work together by enabling peer-to-peer learning. This platform is all about helping each other out.

### Objectives:
- To develop a platform where users can list their skills and connect with people who can help them.
- Connect the 2 users based on their expertise in the particular skill and enabling them to schedule meet to teach each other by connecting the application to a discord server.
- Develop a messaging feature within the app by implementing effective measures to mitigate inappropriate texts.
- Enable two users collaborate and publish their work so others can view it and rate it.
- Arranging video and audio conferences through the official discord server of the app through a discord bot.
- Virtual Study Groups – where people can join rooms and study together.
- Leaderboards for the same – on the amount of time spent.
- Design the discord server accordingly.

### Methodology:
1. Create mock-up UI’s for the application’s Interface structure and design.
2. Create the database schema in MongoDB.
3. Create a backend server and required API’s and testing them.
4. Implement a searching system based on tags for easy navigation.
5. Creating front-end in React by building necessary components and pages.
6. Using CSS and its libraries to style the components and pages.

### Security and verification measures:
1. Profanity filtering within messaging. If obscene language is found the message can be replaced with * or sent for moderation. We can give warnings to users.
2. A report feature for users to report harassment or inappropriate behaviour and a team of moderators for taking action.
3. Users can message each other only if both parties are interested.
4. Enabling user verification through e-mail and phone during account creation to control duplicate accounts.
5. Adding assessments or quizzes for verifying skills within the platform to determine user’s proficiency. Badges can be given based on their performance.
6. Users can endorse each other for more authenticity.
7. Allow users to link their social media accounts if they want to.
8. Users have an option to remain anonymous on the platform. We can promote open communication through this and it also protects privacy.
9. Creating clear and easy-to-understand guidelines about behaviour and actions with rules and consequences.

### References and tools:
- [npm package - bad-words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bad-words)

### Languages and tools:
HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, Python (for discord bot), Discord, Visual studio code, git and GitHub.

### Result:
NA

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, this platform aims to let student and users teach other and enable them to network more. It aims to provide users seamless communication through discord for scheduling meets.

### Future scope:
- Allow different forms of communication like audio and video within the website instead of discord.
- Enable users to schedule meets within the app with an event creation system like Google Calendar.
- Users can be verified for their skills based on quizzes and tests by the website. -->
